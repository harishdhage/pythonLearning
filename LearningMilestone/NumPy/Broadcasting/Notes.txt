Broadcasting in NumPy refers to the ability of performing operations on arrays with
different shapes by automatically expanding the smaller array's shape to match the
larger array's shape. This is useful when performing arithmetic operations or applying
functions to arrays of different dimensions.

Rule
If array1 had shape (1,4) and array2 has shape (4,1), then able broadcast
If array1 had shape (4,4) and array2 has shape (4,1), then able broadcast
If array1 had shape (1,4) and array2 has shape (4,2), then not able broadcast
