In Python, a Singleton class is the implementation of singleton design pattern which
means this type of class can have only one object. This helps in optimizing memory
usage when you perform some heavy operation, like creating a database connection.

If we try to create multiple objects for a singleton class, the object will be created
only for the first time. After that, the same object instance will be returned.
