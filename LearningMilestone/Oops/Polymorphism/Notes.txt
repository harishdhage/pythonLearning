The term polymorphism refers to a function or method taking different forms in
different contexts. Since Python is a dynamically typed language, polymorphism in
Python is very easily implemented.

Types of implementaton
Duck Typing - is a concept where the type or class of an object is less important
than the methods it defines. Using this concept, you can call any method on an object
without checking its type, as long as the method exists.
Operator Overloading - redefining how operators work with custom objects. Suppose you
have created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors, what happens when
you use the plus operator to add them?
Most likely Python will yell at you.
Method Overriding - a method defined inside a subclass has the same name as a
method in its superclass but implements a different functionality.
Method Overloading - is a feature of object-oriented programming where a \
(in single class) class can have multiple methods with the same name but different
parameters. To overload method, we must change the number of parameters or the type
of parameters, or both. Unlike other programming languages like Java, C++, and C#,
Python does not support the feature of method overloading by default.
Python's standard library doesn't have any other provision for implementing method
overloading. However, we can use a dispatch function from a third-party module named
MultipleDispatch for this purpose.
First, you need to install the Multipledispatch module using the following
command - pip install multipledispatch
