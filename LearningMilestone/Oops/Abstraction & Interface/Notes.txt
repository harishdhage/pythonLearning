Abstraction is one of the important principles of object-oriented programming.
It refers to a programming approach by which only the relevant data about an object
is exposed, hiding all the other details. This approach helps in reducing the
complexity and increasing the efficiency of application development.

Types
data abstraction -wherein the original data entity is hidden via a data structure
that can internally work through the hidden data entities.
process abstraction - It refers to hiding the underlying implementation details
of a process

Abstract Class
To create an abstract class in Python, it must inherit the ABC class that is defined
in the ABC module. This module is available in Python's standard library. Moreover,
the class must have at least one abstract method. Again, an abstract method is the
one which cannot be called but can be overridden. You need to decorate it with
@abstractmethod decorator.

Interface
An interface in Python is a programming contract — it’s usually implemented either
with abc.ABC (runtime-enforced abstract base classes) or with typing.Protocol
(static/structural interfaces for type checkers). Python has no separate interface
keyword like Java; Protocol and ABC serve that role.
