Inheritance is one of the most important features of object-oriented programming
languages like Python. It is used to inherit the properties and behaviours of one
class to another. The class that inherits another class is called a child class
and the class that gets inherited is called a base class or parent class.

Types

Single Inheritance - This is the simplest form of inheritance where a child
class inherits attributes and methods from only one parent class.
Multiple Inheritance - Here child class can inherit the property from more
than one class.
Multilevel Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance
