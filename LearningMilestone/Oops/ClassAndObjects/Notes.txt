functions in class should have parameter self

Employee.nums+=1 : Here nums of Emoployee class is called and assigned the value. So
the updated count will remain untill the Class object is alive.
emp3 = emp1 - Here emp3 object is assigned emp1 object. So when the functions called from
emp3 obj, it doesnot runs the same function again. Instead it just passes the previously
result from memory.Hence count is not increased.

@classmethod - Allow operations related to class itself. Takes cls as first parameter
                which represents  class itself.
                Best for class-level data or requires to access class itself
@staticmethod - Best for utility functions that do not need access to class data. Its
                not like java which loads the static method before the object creation.
                This method is not allowed to override.
@instantmethod - Best for operation on instances of class (object)
