Python constructor is an instance method in a class, that is automatically called
whenever a new object of the class is created. The constructor's role is to assign
value to instance variables as soon as the object is declared.

Python uses a special method called __init__() to initialize the instance variables
for the object, as soon as it is declared.

The __init__() method acts as a constructor. It needs a mandatory argument named
self, which is the reference to the object.

Types
Default Constructor - The Python constructor which does not accept any parameter
other than self is called as default constructor.
Parameterized Constructor - If a constructor is defined with multiple parameters
along with self is called as parameterized constructor.

Multiple Constroctor
- Not allowed in Python, but if defined python doesn't throw any error. But it only
  consider the last __init__().
- We can achive multiple constructor call by overloading concept.
